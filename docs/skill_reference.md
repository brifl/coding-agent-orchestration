# Skill Reference

This file consolidates overlapping skill-oriented documentation.

## Source Documents

- `docs/skill_lifecycle.md`
- `docs/skill_manifest.md`
- `docs/skill_sets.md`
- `docs/skill_sources.md`

## Consolidation Plan

1. Keep canonical definitions in this file.
2. Convert repeated sections in source docs to short pointers.
3. Preserve source docs for specialized details only.
