# STATE

**Important** There are multiple instances of files with the same name as this one in this repo. The others are for templating, bootstrapping, or simple examples. This is a real one. This is left to provide a real example of what these look like in use. Use it to actually guide the coding agent. If you _are_ a coding agent, this one's for you!
